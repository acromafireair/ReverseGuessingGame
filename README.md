# ReverseGuessingGame
like the guessing game that every programming tutorial has, except the computer is the one guessing the number

main.cpp is the code
higherwords.txt is a list of words the user can type to tell the program that the number they thought of is higher than the computer's current guess
lowerwords.txt is a list of words the user can type to tell the program that the number they thought of is lower than the computer's current guess
victorywords.txt is a list of words the user can type to tell the program that it has guessed the number the user though of
